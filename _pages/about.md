Hi, I'm Marcus!

I'm leading a research group on data management technologies for scientific application domains, such as, earth observation and radio astronomy, at the [Institute of Data Science](https://www.dlr.de/dw/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-12192/21400_read-49437/) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Jena.

I'm broadly interested in large-scale data management with a focus on building systems to enable efficient query processing on large volumes
of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. I am particularly interested in query processing, query optimization and rewriting, index
structures, algorithms, and data structures.

In my dissertation work, I have developed a high-performance graph processing system that seamlessly blends transactional graph processing with graph
analytics in the same database engine by using graph index structures, efficient algorithms for graph traversals, and code generation techniques
for domain-specific graph query languages.
