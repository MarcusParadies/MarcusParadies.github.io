Hi, I'm Marcus!

I'm leading a research group on data management technologies for scientific application domains, such as, earth observation and radio astronomy, at the [Institute of Data Science](https://www.dlr.de/dw/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-12192/21400_read-49437/) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Jena, Germany.

<p align="justify">
I'm broadly interested in large-scale data management with a focus on building systems to enable efficient query processing on large volumes
of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. I am particularly interested in query processing, query optimization and rewriting, index
structures, algorithms, and data structures.</p>

**Are you a student looking for BSc/MSc thesis projects? Contact [me](mailto:marcus.paradies@dlr.de) for a list of available topics on large-scale data management within our group.**
