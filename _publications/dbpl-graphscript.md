**Abstract.** Real-world graph applications are typically domain-specific and model complex business processes in the property graph data model. To implement a domain-specific graph algorithm in the context of such a graph application, simply providing a set of built-in graph algorithms is usually not sufficient nor does it allow algorithm customization to the user's needs. To cope with these issues, graph database vendors provide---in addition to their declarative graph query languages---procedural interfaces to write user-defined graph algorithms.

In this paper, we introduce GraphScript, a domain-specific graph query language tailored to serve advanced graph analysis tasks and the specification of complex graph algorithms. We describe the major language design of GraphScript, discuss graph-specific optimizations, and describe the integration into an enterprise data platform.
